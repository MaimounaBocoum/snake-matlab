Bugs
 * See redmine issue database
 * lutScanConvertImage: lutFirstLinePos is in number of elements and XOrigin is in mm
 * PRF not modified in acmo.ultrafast ? used in acmo.acmo ?
 * Wrong display axis while using UFBfInfo
 * In lutFlats.m use somthing similar to FlatAngles = All_ACMOs{ModeId}.getParam('FlatAngles'); but which works with elusev
 * Timeouts not working when using popups
 * Bad BF image if InitSequence == 1 in initializeRemote call

Use
 * Ultrafast Color cleanup & host buffer check
 * Create a config class to manage hardware/probe/IP/legHAL and pass it to usse
 * Use a class for +processing as for others

Features
 * Make parameter limits depends on probe pitch and number of elements
 * Manage events calls / jumps
 * Do sequence diagram plot
 * Do a release maker with options for each clients
 * Have a 200 ns accuracy on noops (today the accuracy is 1 us)
 * Have lower PRF by using elusev.pause

UI
 * Alert user if TGC or RxFreq change from one event to another (hardware stabilization time is a limitation)

Optimization
 * Use event calls / repeat
 * Timing managment should be done bottom-up (to avoid top the need to know the bottom)

Documentation
 * Modify documentation concerning uppercase parameters
 * Add legHAL_help explanation
 * Add functions in legHAL_help (use introspection)

Distribution
 * Define what client gets what feature
